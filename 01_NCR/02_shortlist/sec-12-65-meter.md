## Research
### Pros
- Park  facing
- east facing
- near school - price up
- cheaper than sec 10 area

### cons
- construction built cost
- Even with clear papers, self-construction involves sanctioned maps, setbacks, inspections, and local approvals. Any delay directly increases cost.
- boundary wall, gates, leveling, borewell — that’s ₹10–20 lakh before construction even starts.

## Special Notes

- land price compensates for the full construction
