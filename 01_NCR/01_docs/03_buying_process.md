## ✔️ B. Things to do
```
Token → Verification → Registry Day Final Payment → Registration → Possession → Mutation
```
### 1. Check Red Flag 🚩🚩 (Dont Buy)
-  Seller shows only photocopies
-  EC missing mortgage entry explanation
-  Plot not in approved layout
-  No CLU for residential land
-  Seller avoids mutation
-  No bank NOC despite loan history
-  Boundary mismatch

### 2. Questions for Seller
- Is the plot FREEHOLD?
- Are you the sole owner? (Any co-owner / heir?)
- Can you show the ORIGINAL sale deed chain (15–20 yrs)?
- Any loan or mortgage ever taken on this plot? (Bank NOC?)
- Is the land use RESIDENTIAL? (Approved layout / CLU?)
- Is mutation done in your name?
- Any dues pending? (Property tax, society, GDA?)
- Any dispute, notice, or court case?
- Is road access approved and clear?
- Why are you selling? (Listen carefully)

### 5. After Registration (Post-Registry Stage)
