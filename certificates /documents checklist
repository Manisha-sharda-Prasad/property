❌ Seller shows only photocopies
❌ EC missing mortgage entry explanation
❌ Plot not in approved layout
❌ No CLU for residential land

❓ First Questions to Ask the Seller (Short & Practical)::::::::::

Is the plot FREEHOLD?
Are you the sole owner? (Any co-owner / heir?)
Can you show the ORIGINAL sale deed chain (15–20 yrs)?
Any loan or mortgage ever taken on this plot? (Bank NOC?)
Is the land use RESIDENTIAL? (Approved layout / CLU?)
Is mutation done in your name?
Any dues pending? (Property tax, society, GDA?)
Any dispute, notice, or court case?
Is road access approved and clear?
Why are you selling? (Listen carefully)
